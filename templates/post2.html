            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The availability and accessibility of common medicine is a crucial aspect of healthcare, ensuring that individuals can receive necessary treatments for various health conditions. However, in India, a significant portion of the population faces challenges in accessing common medicines. While it is difficult to provide an exact number, a considerable proportion of Indians struggle to obtain the medications they require.

                Several factors contribute to the issue of limited access to common medicine in India. One key factor is the vast population size of the country, which exceeds 1.3 billion people. This large population puts a strain on the healthcare system, making it challenging to ensure adequate medication supply across all regions.
                
                Another significant factor is the economic disparity prevalent in India. A substantial portion of the population falls under the poverty line or faces financial constraints, making it difficult for them to afford essential medicines. Even basic medications can be prohibitively expensive for many individuals, particularly those who lack access to health insurance or government support.
                
                Additionally, the healthcare infrastructure in India faces numerous challenges, particularly in rural areas. Limited availability of pharmacies and healthcare facilities, especially in remote regions, means that individuals often have to travel long distances to access common medicines. This lack of nearby medical services further exacerbates the difficulties faced by those in need.
                
                Furthermore, issues related to the distribution and supply chain also contribute to the problem. India has a vast network of pharmaceutical manufacturers, yet ensuring the smooth flow of medicines to all parts of the country remains a challenge. Inadequate storage facilities, transportation difficulties, and logistical constraints can lead to delays or shortages of essential medicines in certain regions.
                
                The Indian government has taken steps to address this issue. Initiatives such as the Jan Aushadhi scheme, which aims to provide affordable generic medicines, have been implemented to improve access to common drugs. Efforts are also being made to strengthen the healthcare infrastructure and expand the reach of medical services, particularly in underserved areas.
                
                Non-governmental organizations and charitable institutions also play a significant role in bridging the gap. They provide support by organizing medical camps, distributing free medications, and creating awareness about healthcare resources available to marginalized communities.
                
                While progress has been made, the population of Indians who are unable to access common medicines remains substantial. Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach involving government intervention, private sector participation, and improved healthcare infrastructure. Efforts to reduce the cost of medications, improve distribution networks, and expand healthcare services to underserved areas are vital in ensuring that all Indians can access the common medicines they need for their well-being.</p>
